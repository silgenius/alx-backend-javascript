## Introduction

In this directory, you will find various tasks related to the basics of Node.js, focusing on building a foundation in backend development. The exercises cover key concepts such as:

- Node.js runtime environment
- File system interactions
- Handling HTTP requests
- Working with Express.js

These tasks will help you get hands-on experience with Node.js, providing a deeper understanding of server-side JavaScript.

## Requirements

Before running the tasks in this directory, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or above)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

You can install Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org

## Tasks

Each task is implemented in a separate file or set of files, focusing on a specific aspect of Node.js. For example:

- Task 0: **Introduction to Node.js** – Understanding the Node.js environment and simple script execution.
- Task 1: **Working with the File System** – Using Node.js to interact with files on the system.
- Task 2: **HTTP Servers in Node.js** – Setting up basic HTTP servers with Node.js.
- Task 3: **Express.js Basics** – Setting up an Express.js server and handling basic routes.

You can explore each task's README (if present) for further instructions on how to run and test the code.
