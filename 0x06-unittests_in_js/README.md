# 0x06. Unittests in JavaScript

This directory contains the implementation and practice of unit testing in JavaScript. Unit testing is a fundamental aspect of software development that helps ensure that individual units of code function as expected. In this directory, we explore the basics of writing unit tests for JavaScript code using popular testing frameworks.

## Introduction

In this project, we dive into writing unit tests for JavaScript functions. The objective is to understand the importance of testing individual units of code and how it can be achieved in JavaScript using testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of unit testing principles and how to apply them to your own projects.

## Unit Testing in JavaScript

Unit testing in JavaScript helps you ensure that each function or component of your code behaves as expected. This process involves writing test cases for each unit of functionality in your application. Unit testing helps to:

- Identify bugs early in development
- Make refactoring safer and easier
- Improve code quality
- Ensure reliable application behavior

In this directory, we explore various types of tests, including edge cases, and how to write them using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with unit testing in this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username alx-backend-javascript.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd alx-backend-javascript/0x06-unittests_in_js

    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the tests:

    ```
    npm test
    ```
